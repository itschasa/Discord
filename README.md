# Discord Tools, Bots and Code
### All in easy-peasy python.
No point hiding all of my code behind an encrypted wall, so here it is.
Use it how you want to, even learn a couple things or two. I will go in detail (or sometimes briefly) about how the code works and functions. So if you're a coding nerd like me, you will probably enjoy this. :)

If you have anything you'd like to add or just want to talk to people who are similar minded, join my [Discord Server](https://chasa.wtf).
