# Discord Tools, Bots and Code
No point hiding all of my code behind an encrypted wall, so here it is.
Use it how you want to, even learn a couple things or two. I will go in detail (or sometimes briefly) about how the code works and functions. So if you're a coding nerd like me, you will probably enjoy this. :)

**If you want something custom, let me know on discord and we can sort something out. Chasa#0007 (if invalid, go to chasa.wtf)**
