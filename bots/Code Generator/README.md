## Code Generator
You know those servers with "generator" bots? This is the code for them.

### How it works:
* You add codes/logins/whatever in a file.
* People with the role can do -generate and get a random code from the file.
* It removes the code and sends it to the user.

### Features
* Logging: Every single thing that happens is logged in a file.
* Everything is customisable.
