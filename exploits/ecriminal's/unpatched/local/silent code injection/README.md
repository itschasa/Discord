# Silent Local Code Injection

**Description**

This exploit is executed locally on the victim's machine. It will inject itself into the Discord client without modifying any files or the memory. This exploit can be used for MiTM attacks just like Anarchy Grabber 3.0, i.e. sniffing login and payment credentials.

I will keep the exploit private for now.
